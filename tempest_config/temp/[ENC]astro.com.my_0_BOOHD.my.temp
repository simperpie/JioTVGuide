    <title lang="mg">Low Season</title>
    <desc lang="mg">Lin has a sixth sense, which does not always endear her to others. After breaking up with her TV-star boyfriend, Ton, she tires of the city life and runs off to a mountain resort during the low season when she is sure she will not have to put up with pesky tourists. Seeking solitude, she instead encounters a ghost waiting for her in her room. She also meets Puth, a journalist seeking a quiet retreat to write a ghost story. The two of them start spending time together and before long, a spark is ignited. Unlike other boys she has met, Puth does not seem to mind at all that Lin can see 'things' that no one else can. But sure enough, who should show up but Ton, asking Lin to give him another chance.</desc>
