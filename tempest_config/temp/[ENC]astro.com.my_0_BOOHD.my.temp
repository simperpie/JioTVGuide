    <desc lang="mg">Before Suvarnabhumi International Airport is built, the neglected and unoccupied lot was called King Cobra Swamp by the locals.

    <desc lang="mg">Kemal, a young entrepreneur, and his wife Citra, plan to get into the resort business and they have their sights set on the town of Lembang. While scouting the location, Kemal meets Sujiwo, an inn-keeper who offers him an old resort made up of several villas in an large plot of land. The owner has moved overseas and the property is up for sale. Kemal considers the cost savings to renovate rather than to build up a new property, and happily accepts the offer.
